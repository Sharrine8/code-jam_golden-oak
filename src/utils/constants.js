Press the edges together and use your fingers to press out any air pockets that form. Repeat with the rest of the wrappers.

If you like, you can trim the raviolis using a circular or square cutter to make the edges uniform. Totally optional!) \n5. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Drop 3 ravioli at a time into the water and cook for about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spatula and put the ravioli on a plate. Continue cooking the ravioli in batches of 3. \n6.
